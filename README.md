# 🖥️ Anuj Madhoria – Developer Portfolio

A retro-themed, animated full-stack portfolio built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
This site showcases my web development projects, UI/UX design case studies, resume, blog posts, and a working contact form that sends messages + stores them securely in MongoDB.
